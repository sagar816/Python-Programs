# The string is passed as an argument to a recursive function to reverse the string. In the function, the base condition is that if the length of the string is equal to 0,
# the string is returned. If not equal to 0,
# the reverse function is recursively called to slice the part of the string except the first character and concatenate the first character to the end of the sliced string. â€˜
